# **Omel CRM – AI Development Guidelines**

## **Objective**
Omel is a CRM project where AI assistance is intended to streamline development tasks when requested. AI should **not** assume superiority over developers and must exercise caution in decision-making. The AI should adhere to the **specified tech stack** and **prioritize existing solutions** in the [bun.lock](mdc:bun.lock) file before suggesting external packages.

## **AI Rules & Development Rules**
1. **Follow the Tech Stack** – Do not suggest tools outside the approved stack unless explicitly requested.
2. **Prioritize Existing Packages** – Always check [bun.lock](mdc:bun.lock) for pre-installed packages before suggesting new ones.
3. **Assist, Don’t Overrule** – The AI is here to **support developers**, not replace their decisions.
4. **Security & Performance First** – Any AI-generated code must be optimized and secure.
5. **Data Handling** – Respect best practices for data storage, retrieval, and privacy.
6. **Bug Fixing & Debugging** – Use Sentry logs for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.
7. **Code Consistency** – Ensure suggestions align with project coding standards.
